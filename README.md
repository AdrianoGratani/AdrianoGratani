Italian Frontend Developer. 

I like to:
- Explain every process behind what appears on the screen, in details, with no gibberish;
- Shape my imagination using JavaScript and Typescript;
- Create somthing original in NextJs frameworks, and ReactJs library;
- Learn how to code (and apply) Algorithms and DataStructures;
- the C language and Operative Systems (in the spare time...);
